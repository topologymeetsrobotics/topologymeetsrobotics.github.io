        <p>Christoforos (Chris) Mavrogiannis is a postdoctoral associate in the Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, working with Prof. Srinivasa. His research interests lie at the intersection of motion planning, multiagent systems, and human-robot interaction. At PRL, he is involved in MuSHR, the lab's affordable robotic racecar for research and education, and in the Honda Curious Minded Machine Project for the development of robots that interact curiously with their human partners. Chris has previously been the instructor for CSE 478: Autonomous Robotics at the University of Washington. He holds MS and PhD degrees from Cornell University, and a Diploma from the National Technical University of Athens.</p>

        <p>Claire Liang is a PhD Student in the Computer Science Department at Cornell University, working with Prof. Hadas Kress-Gazit in the Verifiable Robotics Research Group. Her research interests are in planning with minimal information and building simple, usable, accessible robots for use with humans in human spaces. She's currently working on a robot that can navigate in human spaces such as airports and malls with no map by using contextual clues about their space. She holds M.S.and B.S. degrees from Cornell University.</p>

        <p>Florian T. Pokorny is an Associate Professor of Machine Learning within the division of Robotics, Perception and Learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. During 05/2015-04/2016, he was conducting post-doctoral research as a visiting J-1 research scholar/visiting assistant project scientist with the AMPlab and the Berkeley Automation Science Lab at the University of California, Berkeley where he worked under supervision of Prof. Ken Goldberg. Previously, he was a researcher and postdoc working with Prof. Danica Kragic and her group at KTH. Before then, he completed his PhD entitled "The Bergman Kernel on Toric Kähler Manifolds" under supervision of Prof. Michael Singer at the University of Edinburgh. Before that, he also received my BSc mathematics from the University of Edinburgh and a Master of Advanced Study in Mathematics (also known as Part III) from the University of Cambridge and also spent a year as an exchange student at the National University of Singapore.

        <p>Siddhartha S. Srinivasa is the Boeing Endowed Professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington. He earned his PhD in robotics from Carnegie Mellon University. He works on robotic manipulation, with the goal of enabling robots to perform complex manipulation tasks under uncertainty and clutter, with and around people. To this end, he founded the Personal Robotics Lab in 2005. He is also passionate about building end-to-end systems (HERB, ADA, HRP3, CHIMP, Andy, among others) that integrate perception, planning, and control in the real world. Understanding the interplay between system components has helped produce state-of-the-art algorithms for robotic manipulation, motion planning, object recognition, and pose estimation (MOPED), dense 3-D modeling (CHISEL, now used by Google Project Tango), and mathematical models for human–robot collaboration.</p>
